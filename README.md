# Room Occupancy and Activity Analytics Service

## Project Overview
This project involves the development of a backend service to provide real-time analytics on room occupancy and activities. The service streams data to a frontend application, which displays the analytics on a user-friendly dashboard alongside live camera feeds.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Analytics**: Provides instant updates on room occupancy and activities.
- **User-friendly Dashboard**: Displays analytics data alongside live camera feeds for enhanced monitoring.
- **Data Visualization**: Improves decision-making through enhanced data visualization.

## Responsibilities
### At the Company
- Delivered various POCs to demonstrate the company's capabilities for industrial-level problem statements.
- Worked on a client's on-site project to deploy an AI solution for a top manufacturing industry.
- Visited multiple client sites to study problem statements and collect data for building AI solutions.
- Converted POC projects into potential clients, contributing to the company's growth.
- Trained various AI models for object detection using the YOLOv4 algorithm.
- Developed a GUI application using PyQT5 for deploying AI solutions at client sites.

### In This Project
- Developed a backend service for real-time occupancy and activity analytics in all rooms.
- Designed a user-friendly dashboard to display analytics alongside live camera feeds.
- Enhanced data visualization and monitoring capabilities to facilitate better decision-making.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For backend service development.
- **Flask**: To create the backend service.
- **OpenCV**: For camera feed integration.
- **YOLOv4**: For object detection and activity recognition.
- **React.js**: For frontend dashboard development.
- **Docker**: For containerization and deployment.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Docker
- Node.js

### Steps
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
